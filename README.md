# Meow Tab
Replaces chrome://newtab with a page displaying the date &amp; time, along with a randomized cat fact and image from two separate APIs. 

# Settings
Accessing the settings panel (via the gear at the top right) allows the user to modify various settings, including:

* Time Format - switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
* Brightness - adjust the brightness of the image.
* Dog/Cat Mode - toggle between dog and cat mode, replacing the randomized fact/image with your preferred fuzzy friend.
* Light/Dark Mode - toggle between a light and dark color palette.

# Usage
Coming soon to the Chrome Extension Store.

If you'd like to use the developer version, please download the repository and navigate to the Google Chrome settings menu. From there, [open the Extensions submenu](chrome://extensions/) and enable developer mode. Click on the "load unpacked" button and open the meow-tab folder.

# Issues
As the cat facts are randomized and sourced from a website that took user-submitted entries, there's unfortunately a chance that some inaccurate information will be pulled from the API. Please make sure to double-check your cat facts before telling them to your friends.
